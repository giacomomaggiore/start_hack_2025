# EchoAnalyticsÂ® - StartHack Project 2025

## Overview
This application listens to conversations between a financial advisor and a client via microphone input. It then predicts the optimal asset allocation, performs a backtest, calculates financial metrics and indexes, and generates a user profile text, updating the output in real-time as the conversation goes on.
